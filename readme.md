  <summary>Task 4.2</summary>

    1. Extend your serverless.yml file with data about your database table and pass it to lambdaâ€™s environment variables section.
    2. Integrate the getProductsList lambda to return via GET /products request a list of products from the database (joined stocks and products tables).
    3. Implement a Product model on FE side as a joined model of product and stock by productId.

  <summary>Task 4.3</summary>

    1. Create a lambda function called createProduct under the same Serverless config file (i.e. serverless.yaml) of Product Service which will be triggered by the HTTP POST method.
    2. The requested URL should be /products.
    3. Implement its logic so it will be creating a new item in a Products table.
    4. Save the URL (API Gateway URL) to execute the implemented lambda functions for later - you'll need to provide it in the PR (e.g in PR's description) when submitting the task.
